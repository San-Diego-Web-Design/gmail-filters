I received 5035 emails during the first two weeks I started working. This was
a 7x increase compared with the 613 emails I received for the same two week period the year before.
I was completely unprepared for such high email
volumes and quickly fell behind in keeping up. As a
result, I'd be lost during team meetings--and even miss some
messages entirely because they were buried under a deluge of alerts and other
noise. What finally got my email under control was setting up filters
to automatically move emails from my inbox to different labels.

Here, I'd like to share the Gmail filters I use to increase the signal to noise ratio in my inbox. You can
download my [Gmail filters](https://github.com/dvdt/gmail-filters) so you can try them in your inbox too.

__Air travel__ emails are among the worst at cluttering your inbox. A flight booked with
United typically has three emails: a reservation confirmation, an
eTicket Itinerary, and a check in reminder. The first two
merely parrot information about a flight that was
booked only moments before; it's much better to label these emails under 'Flights'
and have them skip the inbox. Only the last email
serves a useful purpose as a reminder to check in, but since I already
track my upcoming flights in my calendar using [TripIt](http://www.tripit.com/), the check
in reminder also skips my inbox. 

Other filter/label combinations I've set up to skip my inbox include:

- __eCommerce Receipts__  
	These quickly become very annoying with the high number of orders
	I place on my Amazon Prime and iTunes accounts.
- __Shipping Notifications__  
    See above re Amazon Prime usage.
- __Facebook/Twitter Notifications__  
	I'll admit that I am on Facebook often enough that I don't need a
	separate notification for Facebook activity.[^2]
- __LinkedIn Notifications__  
	It's easier to deal with LinkedIn notifications all at once.
- __Google Calendar Reminders__  
	I already have calendar notifications on my phone and laptop. A
	third reminder via email on top of that is completely
	overkill.

Did you spot the pattern? Most of the emails I filter out are either
unactionable or contain redundant information (or both). I try to
practice [inbox zero](http://inboxzero.com) and have as few emails in my inbox as
possible. Those that do remain become my todo list for the day.
Thus, emails that may be characterized as "notifications with no
further action required" (e.g. receipts and shipping notifications)
should be categorized into the proper label (so I can find it later if
I need to) and immediately removed from the inbox. Emails from
airlines, Facebook, and Google Calendar that fall under the category
of "stuff I already know" should be likewise filtered.

Feel free to contribute your own Gmail filters to the
repo! I hope to make this the premier source of Gmail filters for
every common need.

[^2]: I'm sure some people check Facebook more than
email. Perhaps it would make sense for Facebook to notify them when
they receive an email, instead of vice versa.
